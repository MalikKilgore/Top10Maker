# Top10Maker
Top10Maker lets you make a Top 10 list and share it on social media with a unique weblink attached to your list.

## How to Use
Upon loading the webpage, you'll be placed on the list creation screen.
There are 10 different game slots in the list, where you can search for a game in its search bar, and 
add it to that slot by clicking on it in the pop-up menu (May take a little bit to load initially).

Once you've added the games you want, you can title your list and attach a username to it.
After that, click "Create List" and you're done! 

You can explore previously created lists by clicking the "Explore Lists" button in the navbar.
